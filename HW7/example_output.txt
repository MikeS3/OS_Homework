Analysis:
- RAID0: Provides the highest performance but no redundancy.
- RAID1: Provides redundancy but at the cost of capacity (1/N of total capacity).
- RAID4: Better capacity utilization than RAID1 but parity disk becomes a bottleneck for writes.
- RAID5: Distributes parity to avoid the bottleneck in RAID4 while maintaining redundancy.

If the performance trends match textbook expectations, RAID0 should be fastest for both reads and writes,
while RAID5 should offer better write performance than RAID4 due to distributed parity.
